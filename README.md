menu_fonticons
======

menu_fonticons is an app for Owncloud, written by Christian Brinch, 
DeIC, 2014. This app replaces svg icons in the menu with font-awesome
icons. The advantage is that icon color can be changed in a single 
css entry. Font-awesome icons also provide a more consistent icon
design.
